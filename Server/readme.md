# Game Patching System

This repository contains a patching system for our game, which allows us to automatically download and apply updates to the game client. The patching system supports both Windows and macOS platforms.

## Patching for macOS

When preparing a patch for macOS, follow these instructions to generate the appropriate `.zip` file:

### Steps to Patch for macOS:

1. **Build Your Game**:
   - Build your game for macOS in Unity or another engine. Ensure that the game is working correctly on macOS.
   
2. **Prepare the Contents Folder**:
   - After building the `.app` bundle, navigate to the `Contents` folder inside the `.app` bundle. For example: `MyGame.app/Contents`.

3. **Compress the Contents Folder**:
   - **Important**: Only compress the contents inside the `Contents` folder, NOT the entire `.app` package. This ensures that only the gameâ€™s executable and necessary files are included in the patch.
   
   - On macOS, you can compress the contents using the following command:

     ```bash
     zip -r patch_mac.zip *  # Make sure you're inside the Contents directory
     ```

     This command will create a zip file named `patch_mac.zip` containing all the required files for your patch.

4. **Upload the Patch**:
   - Place the generated `patch_mac.zip` file inside the `public` folder of this repository.
   - The patch file will be served when requested by the patching system.

### Patching for Windows

For Windows, the steps are similar but you'll need to ensure that the entire build is compatible with Windows. Once youâ€™ve packaged the game for Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Build Your Game for Windows**:
   - Use Unity or your game engine to export the game for Windows.

2. **Compress the Windows Build**:
   - Compress the necessary game files into `patch_windows.zip`.

     For example:

     ```bash
     zip -r patch_windows.zip *  # Compress the necessary game files
     ```

3. **Upload the Patch**:
   - Place the generated `patch_windows.zip` file inside the `public` folder of this repository.
   - The patch file will be served when requested by the patching system.

## How the Patching System Works

1. **Version Checking**:
   - The patching system checks the current version of the game using the `version.txt` file. This file should be placed in the `public` directory and contain the current version of the game (e.g., `1.0.0`).
   
2. **Downloading the Patch**:
   - The patching system compares the local version with the remote version found in `version.txt`. If a new version is available, it downloads the appropriate patch file based on the platform:
     - For macOS: The system will download `patch_mac.zip`.
     - For Windows: The system will download `patch_windows.zip`.
   
3. **Applying the Patch**:
   - Once the patch is downloaded, the system extracts the patch file and overwrites the necessary game files in the application directory.
   
4. **Restarting the Game**:
   - After the patch is applied, the game is restarted automatically to apply the changes.

## Notes

- **Platform-Specific Patches**: Ensure you create and upload a separate patch for each platform (Windows and macOS).
- **Permissions on macOS**: After applying a patch on macOS, make sure that the gameâ€™s executable has execute permissions. The patching system will attempt to set the correct permissions automatically.
- **Testing**: Always test the patching system before releasing it to users to ensure that updates are applied correctly on all platforms.
